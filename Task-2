Designing Drag-and-Drop Feature
Flow Diagram for Drag-and-Drop Feature
Instructions:

1. Create a flow diagram to visualize the drag-and-drop feature.
   (a) The diagram should include the following components:
   (b)   User Interface (UI): Canvas, Cards, and Arrows.

2. Actions: Add Card, Drag Card, Drop Card, Resize Card, Connect Cards.
3. Interactions: User actions and system responses.

Example Components for Flow Diagram:

1. Start: User opens the canvas.
2. Add Card: User clicks "Add Card" button.
3. Card Added: A new card appears on the canvas.
4. Drag Card: User clicks and drags the card.
5. Move Card: The card moves as the user drags.
6. Drop Card: User releases the mouse button to drop the card.
7. Resize Card: User resizes the card using resize handles.
8. Connect Cards: User draws an arrow between cards.
9. Show More: User clicks "Show More" to view detailed text in a popup.
10. End: The user interacts with the canvas and cards as needed.
11. Thought Process for Designing a Drag-and-Drop Feature

Define Requirements:

Identify the main features needed: adding cards, dragging, dropping, resizing, connecting, and showing more details.
Understand the user flow and interactions with these features.
Design the UI:

Create a canvas area where users can interact with cards.
Design the card component to include text, show more button, and resizing handles.
Include controls for adding new cards and connecting them with arrows.
Implement Drag-and-Drop:

Use libraries like react-draggable or react-beautiful-dnd for handling drag-and-drop functionality.
Ensure that the cards can be dragged around the canvas and dropped in different positions.
Handle Resizing:

Utilize libraries such as react-resizable to allow users to resize the cards.
Implement minimum and maximum constraints for resizing to maintain usability.
Connect Cards:

Use libraries like react-archer for drawing arrows between cards.
Implement logic to connect and disconnect cards dynamically based on user actions.
Show More Details:

Create a modal or popup component to display detailed text when the user clicks the "Show More" button.
Ensure that the modal appears correctly and is easy to dismiss.
Testing and Refinement:

Test the drag-and-drop feature thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
Refine the UI and interactions based on user feedback and testing results.
Insert Flow Diagram:

To add a flow diagram, you can use Google Drawings:
Go to Insert > Drawing > + New.
Create your flow diagram and click Save and Close to insert it into the document.
Format and Save:

Adjust the formatting as needed.
Click File > Save to save the document.
